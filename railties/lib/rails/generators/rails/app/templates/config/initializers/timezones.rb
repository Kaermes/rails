#By default the available time zones are restricted to a meaningful subset of 146 zones.
#You may define time zones of your own by giving a hash of time zone names (of your choosing)
#as the keys and TZInfo identifiers as the value like so:

#Rails.application.config.time_zones({"Paris" => "Europe/Paris", "Edinburgh" => "Europe/London"})

#This would result in two time zones being available, with names being "Paris" and "Edinburgh"
